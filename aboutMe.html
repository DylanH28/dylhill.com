        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Dylan. First I want to thank you for visiting my website.I'm on a mission to 
            help individuals and companies tell their story through their web presence. To help 
            someone more easily connect with clients while also having fun and growing as a web developer.
            <br> <br> <br>
            Since I got my first job at 17, I've struggled to find my passion. I've moved from place
            to place working various customer service, delivery, and finance jobs. Then I discovered
            programming and the art of web development. Since then I've taken online courses and created
            a portfolio that continues to grow. I'm learning more everyday.
            <br> <br> <br>
            Going forward, I am looking to leverage my programming experience as well as my love for web
            development in the evergrowing web design industry that will allow me to grow and take
            creative risks.
